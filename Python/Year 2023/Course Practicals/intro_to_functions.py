"""
A function is more like a container for holding code blocks to be repeated in a program, rather than writing that same code over and over. It aids time management and flexibility when working on programs, as a function can be called in different places across a program. To create a function:
1.  Define the function
2.  Call the function

1.  Define a function:
Syntax:
            def function_name(parameters):
            statement(s)
            return statement(s)
    It is optional for the function to have parameters, and the return expression is also optional.

2.  Call a function
Syntax:
            function_name(parameters)

Types of Function
1.    Built-in Functions
2.    User-Defined Functions

1.  Built-in Functions
Built-in functions are functions that are already defined in the Python language. They can be used without having to define them first. They can be used in any program. Examples are print(), len(), max(), min(), type()

2.  User-Defined Functions
They are functions defined by users based on the program's need.
