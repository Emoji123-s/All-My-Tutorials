# Operators

"""
They are simply symbols or operators that are used to perform functions in Python. For example

                                        5 + 2
                                5,2 = Operands
                                + = Operator

Aritmetic Operators
+ = Plus/Addition
- = Minus/Subtraction
* = Times/Multiplication
/ = Division (Outputs in float)
% = Modulus/Remainder
// = Flow Division (changes from float to integer)
** = Power
"""

#PEMDAS
# Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction. 
print(5 + 2) # Addition
print(5 - 2) # Subtraction
print(5 * 2) # Multiplication
print(5 / 2) # Division
print(5 % 2) # Modulus, prints the remainder, in thsis case, 1, because 2 goes into 5 twice, with 1 remaining.
print(5 // 2) # Floor Division
print(5 ** 2) # Exponentiation
print(5 + 2 * 3) # Multiplication first, then addition
print((5 + 2) * 3) # Parenthesis first, then multiplication
