#A program to learn string concatenation

print("Hello World\nHello World\nHello World")

#to concatenate strings we use the + operator
print("Hello" + "World") #adding no space
print("Hello" + " " + "World") #adding space
print("Hello" + " World") #adding space

#we can also use the , operator to concatenate strings
print("Hello", "World") #adds space by default
print("Hello", " ", "World") #adds space by default
print("Hello", " World") #adds space by default
print("Hello" + ", " + "World") #adding comma and space

# We can also use a comma to concatenate strings
print("Hello", ",", "World") #adds space by default
print("Hello", ", ", "World") #adds space by default
print("Hello" + ", " + "World") #adding comma and space

# Exercise
# Concatenate the following strings to form a sentence and print it
# Using the first method
print("String Manipulation Exercise\nString Concatenation is done with the + operator\neg, print('Hello' + 'World')\nNew lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# Using the second method
print("String Manipulation Exercise" + "String Concatenation is done with the + operator" + "eg, print('Hello' + 'World')" + "New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# Using the third method
print("String Manipulation Exercise", "String Concatenation is done with the + operator", "eg, print('Hello' + 'World')", "New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
