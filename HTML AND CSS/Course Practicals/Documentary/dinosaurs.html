        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The word <em>extinct</em> originates from Middle English extinct, from Latin <em>extīnctus</em>, the past participle of <em>xtinguere</em> (“to put out, destroy, abolish, extinguish”), corresponding to <em>ex- + stinguere (“to quench”).</em> Replaced native Middle English aqueint, aquenched <em>(“extinguished, extinct”).</em></p>

        <h2>About Extinct Animals</h2>
        <p>Extinct animals are animal species that have stopped breeding, died and no longer exist. The moment the last living species dies is understood as the time of its extinction. The reasons for extinction range from <strong>natural</strong> occurrences, such as <strong>shifts in the Earth's ecosystem</strong> or <strong>natural disasters</strong>, to <strong>human influences</strong> on nature by the overuse of natural resources, <strong>hunting and destruction</strong> of natural habitats.
        In actual theoretical practice, a species not definitely located in the wild in the last <em>50</em> years of current time is textually called <strong>"extinct".</strong></p>

        <p>Titanoboa <em>(/ˌtaɪtənəˈboʊə/; lit. 'titanic boa')</em> is an extinct genus of giant boid, the family that includes all boas and anacondas, snake that lived in what is now <em>La Guajira</em> in northeastern Colombia during the middle and late Paleocene. Titanoboa was first discovered in the 2000s by students from the University of Florida and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, who recovered 186 fossils of Titanoboa from La Guajira. It was named and described in 2009 as <em><strong>Titanoboa cerrejonensis,</strong></em> the largest snake ever found. It was originally known only from thoracic vertebrae and ribs, but later expeditions collected parts of the skull and teeth. Titanoboa is in the subfamily Boinae, being most closely related to other extant boines from Madagascar and the Pacific.They could grow up to <em>12.8 m (42 ft),</em> perhaps even <em>14.3 m (47 ft)</em> long and reach a body mass of <em>730–1,135 kg (1,610–2,500 lb).</em> The discovery of Titanoboa cerrejonensis supplanted the previous record holder, Gigantophis garstini, which is known from the Eocene of Egypt. Titanoboa evolved following the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs, being one of the largest reptiles to evolve after the Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction event. Its vertebrae are very robust and wide, with a pentagonal shape in anterior view, as in other members of Boinae. Although originally thought to be an apex predator, the discovery of skull bones revealed that it was more than likely specialized in preying on fish. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanoboa" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

        <p>Metoposaurus meaning "front lizard" is an extinct genus of stereospondyl temnospondyl amphibian, known from the Late Triassic of Germany, Italy, Poland, and Portugal.[1][2] This mostly aquatic animal [3] possessed small, weak limbs, sharp teeth, and a large, flat head.[4] This highly flattened creature mainly fed on fish, which it captured with its wide jaws lined with needle-like teeth. Many Metoposaurus mass graves have been found, probably from creatures that grouped together in drying pools during drought. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metoposaurus" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
